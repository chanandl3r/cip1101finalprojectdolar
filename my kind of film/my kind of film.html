<p class="description">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     50 First Dates is a 2004 American romantic comedy drama film directed by Peter Segal and starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore with Rob Schneider, Sean Astin, Lusia Strus, Blake Clark, and Dan Aykroyd in supporting roles. It follows the story of Henry, a womanizing marine veterinarian who falls for an art teacher named Lucy. When he discovers she has amnesia, and forgets him when she falls asleep, he resolves to win her over again each new day.
<br>
<br>
Henry Roth is a veterinarian at Sea Life Park Hawaii on Oahu with a policy of only dating visiting tourists to avoid any serious commitments. His closest friends are Ula, a marijuana-smoking Islander; Alexa, his androgynous assistant; Willy, his pet African penguin; and Jocko, a walrus that lives at the park. One day, Henry's boat breaks down, so he goes to the Hukilau Caf√© to wait for the Coast Guard. He sees Lucy Whitmore make architectural art with her waffles. Henry assumes she is a local, which prevents him from introducing himself. He tries to go back to womanizing tourists, but can't seem to get Lucy out of his head. The next day, he comes back and has breakfast with her. They instantly connect and Lucy asks to see him again the next morning.
<br>
<br>
The next day, however, Lucy shows no recollection of ever meeting him. The restaurant owner Sue explains to Henry that the year before, Lucy and her father Marlin went up to the North Shore to pick a pineapple for his birthday. On the way back, a cow wandered through a broken fence and onto the road, causing a car accident that left Lucy with a form of amnesia, whereby she remembers her life up until the night before the accident, and her memory is normal during the day, but those new experiences are lost when she goes to sleep. To save her the heartbreak of reliving the accident, Marlin and Doug, Lucy's lisping steroid-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin's birthday every day.

<p class="description">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     Ted is a 2012 American satirical comedy film directed by Seth MacFarlane (in his directorial debut) and written by MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin, and Wellesley Wild. The film stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, with Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi in supporting roles, and MacFarlane providing the voice and motion capture of the title character. The film tells the story of John Bennett, a Boston native whose childhood wish brings his teddy bear friend Ted to life. However, in adulthood, Ted and John's friendship begins to interfere with the progression of John's relationship with his girlfriend, Lori Collins.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  In 1985, eight-year-old John Bennett is a friendless only child living in Norwood, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, who wishes for his new Christmas gift, a jumbo teddy bear named Ted, to come to life and become his best friend. The wish coincides with a shooting star and comes true, much to the brief horror of his parents; word spreads and Ted briefly becomes a celebrity.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  27 years later, John, now 35, and Ted are still living in Boston, and are still staunch companions enjoying a hedonistic life. John is dating Lori Collins whom he met at a dance club. As their fourth anniversary approaches, Lori hopes to marry John, but feels he can not move forward in life with Ted around. John is hesitant about making Ted leave, but he is persuaded to act when they find Ted at home with a group of prostitutes, with one defecating on the floor, after their anniversary dinner.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Central Intelligence is a 2016 American buddy action comedy film directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber and written by Thurber, Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen. The film stars Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson as two old high school classmates who go on the run after one of them joins the CIA to save the world from a terrorist who intends to sell satellite codes.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In 1996, star athlete Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner is being honored at his high school. Halfway through his speech, a group of bullies led by Trevor Olson throws the morbidly obese nerd Robbie Weirdicht (who was taking a shower in the locker room) into the gymnasium and into the middle of the school assembly. Everyone starts laughing except for Joyner and his girlfriend, Maggie Johnson, who are the only ones sympathetic towards Weirdicht; the former even going as far as to quickly cover him with his varsity jacket in a moment of compassion. He thanks Joyner and flees in embarrassment.

She is displayed as an introvert due to the miserable broken home she lives in. Her mother did not celebrate her eighth birthday, thus she celebrates it herself, wishing new friends to end her lonely state of her childhood. Suddenly, she hears a boy singing "Boneka Abdi", a Sundanese song that is claimed to be invitation for ghosts. She then sees a group of Indonesian-speaking Dutch kids: Peter, Janshen, William, and Hans. The kids, apparitions of their living selves who died during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, can only be seen by Risa. Upon request by Elly, the shamanist Asep explains to Risa that her ability is due to another ability on being able to smell danur, odor of the dead.
